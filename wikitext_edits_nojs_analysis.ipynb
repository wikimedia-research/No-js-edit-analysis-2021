Instrumentation was added in [T263505](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T263505) to send a new event when an edit made with Wikieditor is saved by a user with JS enabled. We started recording these events on 12 May 2021 following the deployment of a fix to the instrumentation.\n",

In this analysis, we assume all non-wikitext edits (`editor_interface ! = 'wikitext'`) or non-page edits (`integration ! = 'page'`)(i.e. edits made with VisualEditor, Discussion Tool or app edits) have JS enabled as these editors require JS to work. \n",
